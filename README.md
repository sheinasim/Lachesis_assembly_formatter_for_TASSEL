#Lachesis_assembly_formatter_for_TASSEL

#    The purpose of this script is to take the output of the Lachesis 
#    assembled .fasta and reorganize and rename the fasta headers
#    so that they are compatible with TASSEL.

#    This can be done by grouping the sequences from the same cluster,
#    and then renaming the sequences in the header so that they are in numerical order (chr1, chr2, chr3...)
